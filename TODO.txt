1. Fix item search so it finds the item after page 1 and to a minimum of 5 orders. (keep aliases for now).
2. Treat enchanted items as unique products in Margins, and calculate crafting costs by tracking enchanted 
    book costs once in Orders or by using the maximum cost found in Search All. Add books to recipe. 
    Add unique button to enchantable items to track once or constantly the books. Add a dropdown to Product
    Page, first result will be highest price for UNENCHANTED ITEM searched, then, in the "Materials" add a 
    dropdown to switch to a list the 3 highest prices for UNENCHANTED ITEM and then ALL the enchanted items,
    with a extendable container of results that moves  Alerts down and extends Max price overtime to not ruin
    the ui. Make SearchAll results show up in Products page too for Enchantments after Tracking results.
3. Fix the headers in Margins.
4. Add a Favorite Items page and toggle.
5. Fix Grouped view after enchanted items change.
6. Fix Margins results list of products.
